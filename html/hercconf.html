<h1>Hercules Version 3: Configuration File</h1>
<p>
This page describes the configuration file for the Hercules S/370,
ESA/390, and z/Architecture emulator.
<p>
The configuration file <b><i>hercules.cnf</b></i> contains the
processor and device layout.  It is roughly equivalent to the IOCDS on
a real System/390.  The configuration file is an ASCII text file.
<h3>Example configuration file</h3>
<p>
Please note that the below example configuration file should not
be considered a good example of what an actual configuration file
looks like. It is only meant to illustrate what some
of the supported configuration file statements look like
and how they are used.

<h3>Comment lines</h3>
<p>
    Blank lines, and lines beginning with a &#035; sign
    or an asterisk, are treated as comments.
    <p>

<hr><!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<a name="system_parameters"></a>
<h3>System parameters</h3>
<p>
    System parameters may appear in any order but they must precede all
    device statements.  Each system parameter must be on a separate line.
    The following system parameters may be specified:

<dl>

<a name="ARCHMODE"></a>
<dt><code>ARCHMODE &nbsp; S/370 &#124; ESA/390 &#124; z/Arch &#124; ESAME</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the initial architecture mode:
    <ul compact>
    <li>use <code>S/370</code> for OS/360, VM/370, and MVS 3.8.
    <li>use <code>ESA/390</code> for MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA,
    Linux/390, and ZZSA.
    <li>use <code>z/Arch</code> or <code>ESAME</code> for z/OS and zLinux.
    </ul>
    <p><code>ESAME</code> is a synonym for <code>z/Arch</code>.
    When <code>z/Arch</code> or <code>ESAME</code> is specified,
    the machine will always IPL in ESA/390 mode,
    but is capable of being switched into z/Architecture mode after IPL.
    This is handled automatically by all z/Architecture operating systems.
    <p>

<a name="ASN_AND_LX_REUSE"></a>
<dt><code>ASN_AND_LX_REUSE &nbsp; DISABLE &#124; ENABLE</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies that the ASN-and-LX-Reuse Facility (ALRF) is to be disabled
    or enabled. The default is disabled. This is a z/Architecture-only
    feature (it is always disabled for S/390 or ESA/390). Set this
    to <code>ENABLE</code>&nbsp; if the operating system supports
    this z/Architecture feature and the use of this feature is desired.
    Set it to <code>DISABLE</code>&nbsp; or do not specify anything
    if the operating system doesn't support this feature, and it
    inadvertently sets CR0 bit 44 to 1, usually leading to unexpected
    program interrupt when instructions such as LASP are issued.
    <p>
    <code>ASN_AND_LX_REUSE</code> may be abbreviated as <code>ALRF</code>
    <p>

<a name="AUTOMOUNT"></a>
<dt><code>AUTOMOUNT &nbsp; <em>[&plusmn;]directory</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the host system directory where the guest is allowed
    or not allowed to automatically load virtual tape volumes from.
    Prefix allowable directories with a '+' plus sign and unallowable
    directories with a '-' minus sign. The default prefix if neither is
    specified is the '+' plus sign (i.e. an allowable directory).
    <p>
    <i><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp;Enabling this feature may have security
    consequences depending on which allowable host system directories you
    specify as well as how your guest operating system enforces
    authorized use of the Set Diagnose (X'4B') channel command code.
    </i>
    <p>
    All host system virtual tape volumes to be "automounted" by the guest
    must reside within one of the specified allowable host system directories
    or any of its subdirectories while not also being within any of the
    specified unallowable directories or any of their subdirectories,
    in order for the guest-invoked automount to be accepted.
    <p>
    Note: specifying a disallowed automount directory does not preclude the
    Hercules operator from manually mounting any desired file via the
    <code>devinit</code> panel command -- even one in a currently defined
    "disallowed" automount directory. The AUTOMOUNT statement only controls
    guest-invoked automatic tape mounts and not manual tape mounts performed
    by the Hercules operator.
    <p>
    All directories must be specified on separate statements, but as many
    statements as needed may be specified in order to describe the desired
    allowable/unallowable directories layout. For convenience, an
    <code>automount</code> panel command is also provided to dynamically
    add/remove new/existing allowable/unallowable automount
    directories at any time.
    <p>
    The automount feature is activated whenever you specify at least
    one allowable or unallowable directory. If only
    unallowable directories are specified, then the current directory
    becomes the only defined allowable automount directory by default.
    <p>
    All specified directories are always resolved to fully-qualified
    absolute directory paths before being saved.
    <p>
    Refer to the description of the virtual tape device
    '<a href="#noautomount">noautomount</a>' option for more information.
    <p>

<a name="AUTO_SCSI_MOUNT"></a>
<dt><code>AUTO_SCSI_MOUNT &nbsp; NO &#124; YES &#124; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies whether automatic detection of SCSI tape mounts are to be
    enabled or not.
    <p>
    Specifying <code>NO</code> or 0 seconds (the default) indicates
    the option is disabled, forcing all SCSI tape mounts to be done
    manually via an appropriate <code>devinit</code> command.
    <p>
    A value from 1 to 99 seconds inclusive enables the option
    and causes periodic queries of the SCSI tape drive to automatically
    detect when a new tape is mounted. Specifying <code>YES</code>&nbsp;
    is the same as specifying 5 seconds, the current default interval.
    <p>
    The <code>scsimount</code> panel command may also be used to display
    and/or modify this value on demand once Hercules has been started. Note
    too that the <code>scsimount</code> panel command also lists any mounts
    and/or dismounts that may still be pending on the drive, as long as
    you've defined your tape drive as a model that has an LCD "display"
    (such as a model 3480, 3490 or 3590).
    <p>
    <i>
    <b>Note:</b> &nbsp;enabling this option may cause Hercules to take
    longer to shutdown depending on the value specified for this option
    as well as how the host operating system (Windows, Linux, etc) and
    associated hardware (SCSI adapter) behaves to drive status queries
    for drives which do not have any media currently mounted on them.
    </i>
    <p>

<a name="CCKD"></a>
<dt><code>CCKD &nbsp; <em>cckd-parameters</em></code>
<dd><p>
    The CCKD command and initialization statement can be used to affect
    cckd processing. The CCKD initialization statement is specified as
    a Hercules configuration file statement and supports the same options
    as the cckd panel command. Refer to the
    <a href="cckddasd.html#cckdcommand">Compressed Dasd Emulation</a>
    web page for more information.
    <p>

<a name="CODEPAGE"></a>
<dt><code>CODEPAGE &nbsp; <em>mapping</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the codepage conversion mapping table used for ASCII/EBCDIC translation.
    <p>

    <code>default</code> specifies traditional Hercules codepage mapping.
    <p>

    Other supported codepage mappings are:

    Iconv single byte codepages may also be used (e.g. <code>UTF8/EBCDIC-CP-NL</code>)
    if the host environment supports iconv.
    <p>

    If no codepage is specified then the environment variable HERCULES_CP
    will be inspected. The default codepage mapping is <code>default</code>.

    <p>

<a name="CNSLPORT"></a>
<dt><code>CNSLPORT &nbsp; <i>nnnn</i></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the port number (in decimal) to which tn3270 and
    telnet clients will connect.
    <p>

    The CNSLPORT statement may also have the form of host:port, where
    the telnet console server will bind to the specified address.
    <p>

<a name="CONKPALV"></a>
<dt><code>CONKPALV &nbsp; <i>(idle,intv,count)</i></code>

    specifies the tn3270 console and telnet clients keep-alive option
    values that control automatic detection of disconnected tn3270/telnet
    client sessions.
    <p>
    <code><i>idle</i></code> &nbsp; specifies the number of seconds
    of inactivity until the first keep-alive probe is
    sent (idle time until first probe, or probe frequency).
    <br><code><i>intv</i></code> &nbsp;
    specifies the interval in seconds between when successive
    keep-alive packets are sent if no acknowledgement is received from
    the previous one (i.e. the timeout value of the probes themselves).
    <br><code><i>count</i></code> &nbsp; specifies the number of unacknowledged
    keep-alive packets sent before the connection is considered to have
    failed.
    <p>
    The default values are 3, 1, and 10. That is, send the initial probe
    3 seconds after the line goes idle and then wait no more than one
    second for it to be responded to. Do this 10 times before considering
    the client as having died.
    <p>
    <i><b>Note:</b></i>
    This is a built-in feature of TCP/IP and allows detection of
    unresponsive TCP/IP <i>connections</i> and not idle clients.
    That is to say, your connection will <i>not</i> be terminated
    after 3 seconds of idle time. Your 3270 session can remain idle for
    many minutes without any data being transmitted.
    If the TCP/IP <i>stack</i> at the other end of the connection --
    not your 3270 client itself -- fails to respond to the
    internal keep-alive probe packets, then it means that the
    TCP/IP stack is down or there has been a break in the
    connection. Thus, even if your 3270 client
    is completely idle, your system's TCP/IP stack itself should still respond
    to the keep-alive probes sent by the TCP/IP stack at the Hercules end
    of the link. If it doesn't, then TCP/IP will terminate the tn3270/telnet
    session which will cause Hercules to disconnect the terminal.
    <p>
    The three values can also be modified on-demand via the <code>conkpalv</code>
    panel command, which has the exact same syntax. Note that the
    syntax is very unforgiving: no spaces are allowed anywhere within the
    parentheses and each value must be separated from the other with a
    single comma.
    <p>
    <i><b>Note:</b></i>
    On Windows platforms the <code><i>count</i></code> value is ignored and
    cannot be changed from its default value of 10.
    Also, some older platforms may ignore all of the values specified
    and use platform default values instead.

<a name="CPUMODEL"></a>
<dt><code>CPUMODEL &nbsp; <em>xxxx</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the 4 hexadecimal digit CPU machine type number
    stored by the STIDP instruction
    <i>Note: Prior to ESA/390 this was known as the CPU model number</i>
    <p>

<a name="CPUPRIO"></a>
<dt><code>CPUPRIO &nbsp; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the priority of the CPU thread.  Default is a nice value
    of 15, which means a low priority such that I/O can be scheduled and
    completed in favour of CPU cycles being burned. On Multi-CPU
    systems, a real CPU can be "dedicated" to Hercules, by giving the
    CPU thread a very high dispatching priority (-20).
    See <a href="#thread_priorities">"Thread Priorities"</a>
    below for more information.
    <p>

    <i><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; CPUPRIO should not have a higher dispatching
    priority than the TOD Clock and timer thread.</i>
    </ol>
    <p>

<a name="CPUSERIAL"></a>
<dt><code>CPUSERIAL &nbsp; <em>xxxxxx</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the 6 hexadecimal digit CPU serial
    number stored by the STIDP instruction
    <p>

<a name="CPUVERID"></a>
<dt><code>CPUVERID &nbsp; <em>xx</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the 2 hexadecimal digit CPU version code
    stored by the STIDP instruction.
    The default version code is FD when ARCHMODE S/370 or ARCHMODE ESA/390
    is specified.  For the z/Architecture mode, the version code is always
    stored as 00 and the value specified here is ignored.
    <p>

<a name="DEFSYM"></a>
<dt><code>DEFSYM &nbsp; <em>symbol</em> <em>value</em></code>
<dd><p>
    Defines symbol <em>symbol</em> as to contain value <em>value</em>. The
    symbol can then be the object of a substitution later in the configuration
    file or for panel commands. If <em>value</em> contains blanks or spaces, then
    it should be enclosed in double quotation marks (&quot;). See
    <a href="#subs">substitutions</a> for a more in-depth discussion
    on this feature.
    <p>
    Substitution is available even in configuration statements,
    meaning it is possible to perform substitution in the <em>DEFSYM</em> statement itself.
    However, symbols are always defined as the last step in the process, so attempting
    to self define a symbol will result in an empty string:
    <code><pre>
    DEFSYM FOO $(FOO)</pre></code>
    Will set symbol FOO to &quot;&quot;
    <p>

<a name="DEVPRIO"></a>
<dt><code>DEVPRIO &nbsp; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the priority of the device threads.  The default value is 8.
    See <a href="#thread_priorities">"Thread Priorities"</a>
    below for more information.
    <p>

    <i><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; DEVPRIO should not have a higher dispatching

    <p>

<a name="DEVTMAX"></a>
<dt><code>DEVTMAX &nbsp; -1 &#124; 0 &#124; <em>nnn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the maximum number of device threads allowed.
    <p>Specify <code>-1</code> to cause 'one time only' temporary threads to be
    created to service each I/O request to a device. Once the I/O request is
    complete, the thread exits. Subsequent I/O to the same device will cause
    another worker thread to be created again.
    <p>Specify <code>0</code> to cause an unlimited number of 'semi-permanent'
    threads to be created on an 'as-needed' basis. With this option, a thread
    is created to service an I/O request for a device if one doesn't already
    exist, but once the I/O is complete, the thread enters an idle state waiting
    for new work. If a new I/O request for the device arrives before the timeout
    period expires, the existing thread will be reused. The timeout value is
    currently hard coded at 5 minutes. Note that this option can cause one thread
    (or possibly more) to be created for each device defined in your
    configuration. Specifying <code>0</code> means there is no limit to the
    number of threads that can be created.
    <p>Specify a value from <code>1</code> to <code><em>nnn</em></code> &nbsp;to set an upper limit
    to the number of threads that can be created to service any I/O request to
    any device. Like the <code>0</code> option, each thread, once done servicing
    an I/O request, enters an idle state. If a new request arrives before the
    timeout period expires, the thread is reused. If all threads are busy when
    a new I/O request arrives however, a new thread is created <i>only</i> if the
    specified maximum has not yet been reached. If the specified maximum number
    of threads has already been reached, then the I/O request is placed in a queue
    and will be serviced by the first available thread (i.e. by whichever thread
    becomes idle first). This option was created to address a threading issue
    (possibly related to the cygwin Pthreads implementation) on Windows systems.
    <p>The default for Windows is <code>8</code>. The default for all other systems
    is <code>0</code>.
    <p>

<a name="DIAG8CMD"></a>
<dt><code>DIAG8CMD &nbsp; DISABLE &#124; ENABLE [ECHO &#124; NOECHO]</code>
<dd><p>
    When <code>ENABLE</code> is specified, commands issued through the Diagnose 8 interface
    will be executed by Hercules as Hercules commands.  When set to <code>DISABLE</code>,
    commands issued through the Diagnose 8 interface will generate a Specification
    Exception program interrupt on the issuing CPU.
    <p>An optional second argument can be given to request whether the commands
    issued using the Diagnose 8 interface will be traced at the console. This may be
    useful for programs that routinely issue panel commands using the Diagnose 8 interface.
    When <code>ECHO</code> is specified, a message is issued as the panel is about to issue
    the command, the command is redisplayed as if it was entered through the panel input
    line, and a final message is issued to indicate the command completed. When <code>NOECHO</code>
    is specified, no such messages are displayed and the command completes silently.
    <p>The value of <code>ECHO</code> or <code>NOECHO</code> has no effect on
    command output being placed into a response buffer if the Diagnose 8 interface
    requested one.
    <p>The default is <code>DISABLE NOECHO</code>
    <p>

    <i><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; Enabling this feature may have security consequences.</i>
    <p>

    When this feature is enabled it is possible for guest operating systems
    running under Hercules to issue commands directly to the host operating system
    by means of the Hercules <code>sh</code> (shell) command. This ability may be
    disabled via the <a href="#SHCMDOPT">SHCMDOPT</a> statement.
    <p>

<a name="ECPSVM"></a>
<dt><code>ECPSVM &nbsp; YES &#124; NO &#124; LEVEL <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies whether ECPS:VM (Extended Control Program Support : Virtual Machine)
    support is to be enabled. If <code>YES</code> is specified, then the support
    level reported to the operating system is <code>20</code>. The purpose of
    ECPS:VM is to provide to the VM/370 Operating system a set of shortcut
    facilities to perform hypervisor functions (CP Assists) and virtual
    machine simulation (VM Assists). Although this feature does not affect
    VM Operating system products operating in XA, ESA or z/Architecture mode,
    it will affect VM/370 and VM/SP products running under VM/XA, VM/ESA or z/VM.
    Running VM/370 and VM/SP products under VM/XA, VM/ESA or z/VM should be
    done with ECPS:VM disabled. ECPS:VM should not be enabled in an AP or MP
    environment. ECPS:VM has no effect on non-VM operating systems. It is
    however recommended to disable ECPS:VM when running native non-VM operating
    systems. If a specific LEVEL is specified, this value will be reported
    to the operating system when it issues a Store ECPS:VM level, but it
    doesn't otherwise alter the ECPS:VM facility operations. This is a partial
    implementation.

<a name="ENGINES"></a>
<dt><code>ENGINES &nbsp; [<em>nn</em>*]CP&#124;IL&#124;AP&#124;IP[,...]</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the type of engine for each installed processor.
    The default engine type is CP.
    <p>
    <em>nn</em>* is an optional repeat count.
    Spaces are not permitted.
    <p>
    Examples:
    <p>
    <code>ENGINES CP,CP,AP,IP</code>
    <br>specifies that processor engines 0 and 1 are of type CP, engine 2 is
    type AP, and engine 3 is type IP.
    <p>
    <code>ENGINES 4*CP,2*AP,2*IP</code>
    <br>specifies that the first four processor engines (engines 0-3) are of
    type CP, the next two (engines 4-5) are of type AP, and the next two
    (engines 6-7) are of type IP.
    <p>
    The number of installed processor engines is determined by the
    <a href="#MAXCPU">MAXCPU</a> statement.
    If the ENGINES statement specifies more than MAXCPU engines, the excess
    engines are ignored. If fewer than MAXCPU engines are specified, the
    remaining engines are set to type CP.
    <p>

<a name="HERCPRIO"></a>
<dt><code>HERCPRIO &nbsp; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the process priority for Hercules.  The default is 0.
    See <a href="#process_priorities">"Process Priorities"</a>
    below for more information.
    <p>

<a name="HTTPPORT"></a>
<dt><code>HTTPPORT &nbsp; <em>nnnn</em> [AUTH &#124; NOAUTH] [ <em>userid password</em> ]</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the port number (in decimal) on which the HTTP server
    will listen. The port number must either be 80
    or within the range 1024 - 65535 inclusive. If no HTTPPORT statement is
    present or an invalid port number is specified, then the HTTP server thread
    will not be activated.<br>
    <tt>AUTH</tt> indictates that a userid and password are required to access
    the HTTP server, whereas <tt>NOAUTH</tt> indicates that a userid and password
    are not required. The userid and password may be any valid string.
    <p>

<a name="HTTPROOT"></a>
<dt><code>HTTPROOT &nbsp; <em>directory</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the root directory where the HTTP server's files reside.
    If not specified, the default value for Win32 builds of Hercules is the
    directory where the Hercules executable itself is executing out of, and for
    non-Win32 builds it is the directory specified as the default package
    installation directory when the Hercules executable was built (which can
    vary depending on how the Hercules package was built, but is usually
    <tt>/usr/local/share/hercules/</tt>).
    <p>

<a name="IGNORE"></a>
<dt><code>IGNORE &nbsp; INCLUDE_ERRORS</code>
<dd><p>
    Indicates that errors caused by subsequent
    <code><a href="#INCLUDE">INCLUDE</a></code> statements
    for files which do not exist should instead be ignored rather
    than causing startup to be aborted (as would otherwise normally
    occur).
    <p>

<a name="INCLUDE"></a>
<dt><code>INCLUDE &nbsp; <em>filepath</em></code>
<dd><p>
    An <code>INCLUDE</code> statement tells Hercules configuration file
    processing to treat the contents of the file specified by <em>filepath</em>
    as if its contents had appeared in the configuration file at the point
    where the <code>INCLUDE</code> statement appears.
    <p>
    Note that the included file may itself contain yet another
    <code>INCLUDE</code> statement as long as the maximum nesting depth
    (current 8) is not exceeded.
    <p>

<a name="IODELAY"></a>
<dt><code>IODELAY &nbsp; <em>usec</em> [NOWARN]</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the amount of time (in microseconds) to wait after
    an I/O interrupt is ready to be set pending.  This value can also be
    set using the Hercules console.  The purpose of this parameter is to
    bypass a bug in the <b>Linux/390</b> and <b>zLinux</b> <code>dasd.c</code>
    device driver. The problem is more apt to happen under Hercules than
    on a real machine because we may present an I/O interrupt sooner than a
    real machine.
    <p>
    If the IODELAY value is non-zero a warning message (HHCCF037W) will be
    issued unless <code>NOWARN</code> is specified.
    <p>
    NOTE : <a href="#OSTAILOR"><code>OSTAILOR LINUX</code></a> no longer sets
    IODELAY to 800 since the problem described above is no longer present in
    recent versions of the Linux kernel.
    <p>

<a name="LDMOD"></a>
<dt><code>LDMOD &nbsp; <em>module list</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies additional modules that are to be loaded by the Hercules dynamic loader.
    The default search order is with the hercules directory in the default DLL search
    path. Most systems also support absolute filenames (ie names starting with '/'
    or '.') in which case the default search path is not taken.
    <p>
    Multiple LDMOD statements may be used.
    <p>

<a name="LEGACYSENSEID"></a>
<dt><code>LEGACYSENSEID &nbsp; OFF &#124; DISABLE &#124; ON &#124; ENABLE</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies whether the SENSE ID CCW (X'E4') will be honored for
    the devices that originally didn't support that feature. This
    includes (but may not be limited to) 3410 and 3420 tape drives,
    2311 and 2314 direct access storage devices,
    and 2703 communication controllers.
    <p>

    Specify <code>ON</code> or <code>ENABLE</code> if your guest
    operating system needs the Sense ID support to dynamically
    detect those devices. Note that most current operating systems
    will not detect those devices even though Sense ID is enabled
    because those devices never supported the Sense ID in the first
    place. So this mainly applies to custom built or modified versions
    of guest operating systems that are aware of this specific Hercules
    capability.
    <p>

    Because those legacy devices didn't originally support this command,
    and for compatibility reasons, the default is <code>OFF</code>
    or <code>DISABLE</code>.
    <p>

<a name="LOADPARM"></a>
<dt><code>LOADPARM &nbsp; <em>xxxxxxxx</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the eight-character IPL parameter which is used
    by some operating systems to select system parameters.
    <p>

<a name="LOGOPT"></a>
<dt><code>LOGOPT &nbsp; TIMESTAMP &#124; NOTIMESTAMP</code>
<dd><p>
    sets Hercules log options. TIMESTAMP causes messages to the log
    to be time stamped.  NOTIMESTAMP prevents time stamping of log
    messages.    TIMESTAMP and NOTIMESTAMP may be abbreviated as
    TIME and NOTIME respectively.  The current resolution of the
    stamp is one second.
    <p>
    The default is TIMESTAMP.
    <p>

<a name="LPARNAME"></a>
<dt><code>LPARNAME &nbsp; <em>name</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the LPAR name returned by DIAG X'204'.  The default is
    <code>HERCULES</code>.
    <p>

<a name="LPARNUM"></a>
<dt><code>LPARNUM &nbsp; <em>xx</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the one- or two-digit hexadecimal LPAR identification number
    stored by the STIDP instruction.
    If a one-digit number is specified then STIDP stores a format-0 CPU ID.
    If a two-digit number is specified then STIDP stores a format-1 CPU ID.
    If LPARNUM is not specified, then STIDP stores a basic-mode CPU ID.
    <p>

<a name="MAINSIZE"></a>
<dt><code>MAINSIZE &nbsp; <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the main storage size in megabytes, where
    <code><em>nnnn</em></code>&nbsp; is a decimal number. The lower limit is 2.
    The actual upper limit is determined by your host system's architecture
    and operating system, and (on some systems) the amount of physical
    memory and paging space you have available.
    <p>

<a name="MANUFACTURER"></a>
<dt><code>MANUFACTURER &nbsp; <em>name</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the MANUFACTURER name returned the STSI instruction.  The default is
    <code>HRC</code>.
    <p>

<a name="MAXCPU"></a>
<dt><code>MAXCPU &nbsp; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the number of installed processor engines.
    The <a href="#NUMCPU">NUMCPU</a> statement specifies the number of
    engines which will be configured online at startup time.
    All processors are CP engines unless otherwise specified by the
    <a href="#ENGINES">ENGINES</a> statement.
    <p>
    The value of MAXCPU cannot exceed the value of <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code>.
    If MAXCPU is not specified then the default value is the value of
    <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code>.
    <p>
    <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code> is a compile-time variable which sets
    an upper limit on the value of MAXCPU.
    The value of <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code> is displayed in the
    Build information message on the Hercules control panel at startup time.
    To change the value of <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code> you must rebuild
    Hercules.
    For Unix builds, specify
    <tt>./configure --enable-multi-cpu=<em>nn</em></tt>
    before performing make.
    For Windows builds, specify
    <tt>SET MAX_CPU_ENGINES=<em>nn</em></tt>
    before performing nmake.
    <p>
    <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code> may be up to 128 on 64-bit Linux platforms.
    On Windows, and on all 32-bit platforms, the maximum value is 64.
    For performance reasons,
    values above 32 are not recommended for 32-bit platforms.
    If <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code> is set to 1 then multiprocessing is disabled.
    See also <a href="#NUMCPU">NUMCPU</a> for a discussion of the performance
    implications of <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code>.
    <p>

<a name="MODEL"></a>
<dt><code>MODEL &nbsp; <em>hardware_model</em>
    [ <em>capacity_model</em> ]
    [ <em>perm_capacity_model</em> ]
    [ <em>temp_capacity_model</em> ]
    </code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the MODEL names returned by the STSI instruction.
    <p>
    If two operands are supplied, the first is the hardware model name (CPC
    ND model) and the second is the capacity model name (CPC SI model).
    If only one operand is supplied, it is used as both the hardware model
    name and the capacity model name.
    The optional third and fourth operands specify the permanent capacity
    model name and the temporary capacity model name respectively.
    <p>
    The default is <code>EMULATOR</code>.
    <p>

<a name="MODPATH"></a>
<dt><code>MODPATH &nbsp; <em>path</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the path where dynamic modules are loaded from. When a modpath
    statement is specified, the path on the modpath statement is searched before
    the default path is searched. When a relative path is specified is interpreted
    as a relative path within the default search path, if an absolute path is
    specified is interpreted as such.
    <p>
    The default MODPATH is hercules, which means modules are loaded from the
    directory hercules within the default LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    <p>

<a name="MOUNTED_TAPE_REINIT"></a>
<dt><code>MOUNTED_TAPE_REINIT &nbsp; DISALLOW &#124; ALLOW</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies whether reinitialization of tape drive devices (via the
    <code>devinit</code> command, in order to mount a new tape) should
    be allowed if there is already a tape mounted on the drive.
    <p>
    Specifying <code>ALLOW</code> (the default) indicates new tapes may
    be mounted (via <code>'devinit <i>nnnn</i> <i>new-tape-filename</i>'</code>)
    irrespective of whether or not there is already a tape mounted on the drive.
    <p>
    Specifying <code>DISALLOW</code> prevents new tapes from being mounted
    if one is already mounted. When <code>DISALLOW</code> is specified
    and a tape is already mounted on the drive, it must first be unmounted
    (via the command <code>'devinit <i>nnnn</i> *'</code>) before
    the new tape can be mounted. Otherwise the devinit attempt to mount
    the new tape is rejected.
    <p>
    This option is meant as a safety mechanism to protect against
    accidentally dismounting a tape from the wrong drive as a result of
    a simple typo (thereby cancelling a potentially important tape job)
    and was added by user request.
    <p>
    Also note that for SCSI tape drives the <code>'devinit <i>nnnn</i> *'</code>
    command has no effect as the tape must be unmounted manually (since it is
    a real physical device and not one emulated via a disk file like .AWS tapes).
    <p>

<a name="NUMCPU"></a>
<dt><code>NUMCPU &nbsp; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the number of emulated processor engines
    which will be configured online at startup time.
    NUMCPU cannot exceed the value of <a href="#MAXCPU">MAXCPU</a>.
    If NUMCPU is less than <a href="#MAXCPU">MAXCPU</a>
    then the remaining engines can be configured online later.

    <p>
    Multiprocessor emulation works best
    if your host system actually has more than one physical CPU, but you can
    still emulate multiple CPUs nervertheless  even on a uniprocessor system
    (and you might even achieve a small performance benefit when you do).
    There is little point, however, in specifying <tt>NUMCPU</tt> greater
    than 1 unless your guest operating system (running under Hercules) is
    actually able to support multiple CPUs (and if you do not actually need
    multiprocessor emulation, then setting <tt>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</tt> to 1 at
    compile time might even produce a slight performance advantage too).
    <p>

<a name="NUMVEC"></a>
<dt><code>NUMVEC &nbsp; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the number of emulated vector facilities. Default is one per
    CPU. Only available by default in ESA/390 mode.
    <p>

<a name="OSTAILOR"></a>
<dt><code>OSTAILOR &nbsp; OS/390 &#124; z/OS &#124;
    VM &#124; VSE &#124; LINUX &#124; QUIET &#124; NULL</code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the intended operating system.  The effect of this
    parameter is to reduce control panel message traffic by
    selectively suppressing trace messages for program checks
    which are considered normal in the specified environment.
    <code>QUIET</code> discards all exception messages.
    <code>NULL</code> allows all exception messages to be logged.
    <p>
    Optionally prefix any value except <code>QUIET</code> or
    <code>NULL</code> with '+' to cause the suppressions for that
    environment to be combined (added) to those already specified,
    or with '-' to remove such suppressions (i.e. to allow them).
    <p>
    If the <code>OSTAILOR</code>
    statement is omitted, exception messages for program checks
    10, 11, 16, and 1C are suppressed.
    <p>
    Use the <code>ostailor</code> or <code>pgmtrace</code> panel
    commands to display or alter the current settings.
    <p>

<a name="PANRATE"></a>
<dt><code>PANRATE &nbsp; SLOW &#124; FAST &#124; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the panel refresh rate, in milliseconds between refreshes. SLOW
    is the same as 500, and FAST is the same as 50. A value less than the
    Linux system clock tick interval (10 on Intel, 1 on Alpha), or more than
    5000, will be rejected. SLOW is the default.
    <p>

<a name="PANTITLE"></a>
<dt><code>PANTITLE &nbsp; <em>"title-string"</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies an optional console window title-bar string to be used

    This option takes effect only when the Hercules console is displayed
    on an xterm terminal (commonly used on Unix systems), or
    in a Windows command prompt window.
    Note that this option has no effect when Hercules is run under control
    of the Hercules GUI since Hercules's console window is hidden in favor
    of using the GUI's window instead.

    (<code>1900</code>) for all systems except OS/360. Use <code>1960</code>
    for OS/360.  Values other than these were formerly used to offset the
    TOD clock by a number of years to move the date before the year 2000 for
    non-Y2K-compliant operating systems. This use is deprecated, and support
    will be removed in a future release; at that time, only values of
    <code>1900</code> or <code>1960</code> will be accepted. Other values
    will produce a warning message with the equivalent values to specify in
    the SYSEPOCH statement.<br>

<a name="TIMERINT"></a>
<dt><code>TIMERINT &nbsp; DEFAULT &#124; <em>nnnn</em></code>

    specifies the internal timers update interval, in microseconds.  This
    parameter specifies how frequently Hercules's internal timers-update thread
    updates the TOD Clock, CPU Timer, and other architectural related
    clock/timer values.  The default interval is 50 microseconds, which
    strikes a reasonable balance between clock accuracy and overall host
    performance. The minimum allowed value is 1 microsecond and the maximum
    is 1000000 microseconds (i.e. one second).
    <p>
    <i><b>Caution:</b> &nbsp; While a lower TIMERINT value may help
    increase the accuracy of your guest's TOD Clock and CPU Timer values,
    it could also have a severe negative impact on the overall performance

<dt><code>TODDRAG &nbsp; <em>nn</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the TOD clock drag factor.  This parameter can be used
    to slow down or speed up the TOD clock by a factor of <em>nn</em>.
    A significant slowdown can improve the performance of some operating
    systems which consume significant amounts of CPU time processing
    timer interrupts.
    A drag factor of 2.0 slows down the clock by 50%. A drag factor of
    0.5 doubles the speed of the clock. A drag factor of 1.01 slows
    down the clock by 1%, and 0.99 speeds up the clock by 1%.

    <code>REGSFIRST</code> displays the current register contents followed by
    the instruction about to be executed such that pressing enter (to execute
    the displayed instruction) then shows the updated registers followed by
    the next instruction to be executed.
    <p>
    <code>NOREGS</code> suppresses the registers display altogether
    and shows just the instruction to be executed.
    <p>
    In addition to the <code>TRACEOPT</code> configuration file statement
    there is also a corresponding <code>traceopt</code> panel command to
    dynamically display and/or update the current setting at any time.

<a name="TZOFFSET"></a>
<dt><code>TZOFFSET &nbsp; &plusmn;<em>hhmm</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies the hours and minutes by which the TOD clock will
    be offset from the current system time.  For GMT, use the
    default value (+0000).  For timezones west of Greenwich, specify
    a negative value (example: <code>-0500</code> for US Eastern Standard
    Time, <code>-0800</code> for US Pacific Standard Time).
    For timezones east of Greenwich, specify a positive value

<a name="YROFFSET"></a>
<dt><code>YROFFSET &nbsp; &plusmn;<em>years</em></code>
<dd><p>
    specifies a number of years to offset the TOD clock from the actual
    date. Positive numbers will move the clock forward in time, while
    negative numbers will move it backward. A common value for
    non-Y2K-compliant operating systems is <code>YROFFSET -28</code>, which
    has the advantage that the day of the week and the presence or absence
    of February 29 is the same as the current year. This value may not be
    specified as greater than &plusmn;142 years, the total range of the TOD
    clock. Specifying a value that causes the computed TOD clock year to be
    earlier than the value of <a href="#SYSEPOCH"><code>SYSEPOCH</code></a>
    or more than 142 years later than that value will produce unexpected
    results.

<a name="subs"></a>
<h3>Symbol substitutions</h3></a>
<p>
    In configuration and device statements, as well as in panel commands and OAT files,
    symbols may be substituted for text.

<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
    To substitute symbol <em>symbol</em> with its contents, the symbol should be enclosed
    within parenthesis and preceded by a $ sign. For example, if symbol <em>FOO</em> contains
    the text string <em>&quot;BAR&quot;</em> then <em>$(FOO)</em> will be substituted with the
    string <em>&quot;BAR&quot</em>;. Symbol names are case sensitive.

<h5>Example</h5><code><pre>
        DEFSYM  TAPEDIR  &quot;/home/hercules/tapes&quot;

        ...

        0380  3420  $(TAPEDIR)/scratch.aws

        ...</pre></code>
<p>
    In this example, device 0380 will be a 3420 loaded with the AWS tape file in /home/hercules/tapes/scratch.aws
<h4>Special symbols</h4>
    <h5>Device group symbols</h5>
    <p>
        When multiple devices are defined with a single device definition statement, then the symbols<P>
            <TABLE BORDER=0>
                <ul compact>
                    <TR><TD><LI>&nbsp; CUU  &nbsp; </TD><TD> &nbsp; (3 digits device number, upper case hexadecimal digits)</TD></TR>
                    <TR><TD><LI>&nbsp; CCUU &nbsp; </TD><TD> &nbsp; (4 digits device number, upper case hexadecimal digits)</TD></TR>
                    <TR><TD><LI>&nbsp; cuu  &nbsp; </TD><TD> &nbsp; (3 digits device number, lower case hexadecimal digits)</TD></TR>
                    <TR><TD><LI>&nbsp; ccuu &nbsp; </TD><TD> &nbsp; (4 digits device number, lower case hexadecimal digits)</TD></TR>
                </ul>
            </TABLE>
        <p>
        are defined to contain for each device the relevant device address. For example:
        <p>
<code><pre>
    0200,0201  3340  /home/hercules/dasds/myvols.$(CUU)
</pre></code>
        <p>
        will define two 3340 packs, with device 0200 being loaded with the file myvols.200 and
        device 0201 defined with myvols.201.
    <h5>Environment variables</h5>
    <p>
        If a symbol is not explicitly defined by a DEFSYM statement and an environment
        variable by the same name exists, the string contents of that environment variable
        will be used for substitution.
    <h5>Undefined symbols</h5>
    <p>
        If a symbol is not defined by an explicit DEFSYM, is not an automatically generated symbol
        and is not an environment variable, an empty string will be substituted.
    <h4>Escaping substitution, recursion</h4>
    <p>
        To be able to specify the '$(' string without incurring substitution, an additional '$' sign
        should be used. For example, $$(FOO) will not be substituted. If substitution is required but
        the preceding text is to contain a '$' sign as the very last character, then $$$(FOO) should be
        specified. Thus, if symbol FOO contains &quot;BAR&quot;, then $$(FOO) will remain &quot;$$(FOO)&quot; while $$$(FOO)
        will become &quot;$BAR&quot;.
    <p>
        Substitution is <i>not</i> recursive (only one substitution pass is made).
    <p>
<hr><!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<a name="ENHSYMINC"></a>
<h3>Enhanced symbol substitutions</h3></a>
<p>
    Enhanced symbol substitution differs from the above normal symbol substitution
    in several very important ways:
    <p>
    First, the syntax is different. Enhanced substitution symbol names are specified
    using <code>${var}</code> (dollar + brace) rather than <code>$(var)</code>
    (dollar + parenthesis).
    <p>
    Second, the enhanced syntax supports specifying a default value that is to be used
    instead whenever the name symbol is otherwise not defined. The default value is
    placed within the opening and closing braces just as the symbol name is, but
    separated from it by either a single equal sign '<code>=</code>' or a
    colon-equal-sign '<code>:=</code>'.
    <p>
    For example, specifying "<code>${DASD_PATH=dasd/}</code>" in your configuration
    file requests that the value of the "DASD_PATH" symbol or environment variable be
    substituted, or, if the variable is undefined, to use the value "<code>dasd/</code>"
    instead. If no default value is specified then an empty string is used instead.
    <p>
    Finally, enhanced symbol substitution occurs only from host defined environment
    variables and <i>not</i> from any identically named <code>DEFSYM</code> symbol
    should one exist. For example, if environment variable 'FOO' is defined with the
    value "bar", then the configuration file statement "<code>DEFSYM FOO myfoo</code>"
    followed immediately by the statement "<code>${FOO}</code>" causes the value
    "<code>bar</code>" to be substituted and <i>not</i> '<code>myfoo</code>' as might
    otherwise be believed, whereas the statement "<code>$(FOO)</code>", since it is
    a normal symbol substitution sequence <i>does</i> get replaced with "<code>myfoo</code>"
    (since that was the value defined to it via the preceding <code>DEFSYM</code>
    statement).
    <p>
    In other words each symbol substitution technique is supported completely separately
    from one another. <code>DEFSYM</code> allows one to define/undefine/use private (internally
    defined) symbols separate from the host operating system's environment variable pool,
    whereas the enhanced symbol substitution does not and instead only allows read-only
    access to the host's environment variable pool with no support for modifying an already
    defined symbol (environment variable) but a nonethless convenient means of defining
    a default value to be used should the specified host environment variable be currently
    undefined.
    <p>
    Further note that symbol names, being the names of environment variables, are subject
    to whatever case sensitivity or case insensitivity that the host operating system
    happens to enforce/allow. On Windows, environment variables are not case sensitive, whereas on other
    operating systems they may be. Thus "<code>${FOO}</code>", "<code>${foo}</code>",
    "<code>${Foo}</code>", etc, all cause the same value to be substituted on Windows,
    whereas the <code>DEFSYM</code> symbols <code>$(FOO)</code> and <code>$(foo)</code>,
    being two completely different and unique symbols, could be substituted with two
    completely different values (since <code>DEFSYM</code> <b><i>is</i></b>
    case sensitive across <i>all</i> supported platforms, <i>including</i> Windows).
    <p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
    To substitute symbol <em>symbol</em> with the current environment variable value,
    the symbol should be enclosed within braces and preceded by a $ sign. For example,
    if an environment variable named <code>FOO</code> holds the value "BAR", then
    <code>${FOO}</code> will be substituted with the string "BAR". If the environment variable
    "FOO" is not defined then a null (empty) string is substituted instead.
    <p>
    If the string "<code>${FOO:=myfoo}</code>" is used instead, then the value "BAR" will still be
    substituted if the value "BAR" was indeed previously assigned to FOO, but will be
    substituted with the value "<code>myfoo</code>" instead if the environment variable
    FOO is currently undefined.
    <p>
    Note too that the default value is a literal
    string and no substitution is applied to it. Thus attempting to use the syntax
    "<code>${foo=${bar}}</code>" will <i>not</i> yield the expected results. It will
    <i>not</i> be substituted with the currently defined value of the "bar" environment
    variable, but rather will <i>always</i> be substituted with the literal string
    "<code>${bar</code>" followed immediately by the literal character '<code>}</code>'.
    <p>
    Symbol names (environment variable names) are not case sensitive on Windows whereas
    they might be on other host operating systems.

    On a Linux/Unix host, Hercules needs to be a setuid root
    program to allow it to reset its dispatching priority to a high
    (negative) value
    (i.e., <code>chown root.root hercules; chmod +s hercules</code>).

<h3>Device statements</h3>

<p>
    The remaining statements in the configuration file are device statements.
    There must be one device statement for each I/O device or group of
    identical I/O devices. The format of the device statement is:
    <p>

    <code><em>devnum(s) &nbsp; devtype</em> &nbsp; [ <em>arguments</em> ] &nbsp; [ <em># comments...</em> ] </code>
    <p>

    where the generic syntax for device numbers is &nbsp;
    <code>[n:]CCUU[,CCUU][-CCUU][.nn][...]</code> &nbsp;
    as explained below:


<dl> <!-- begin Device statements -->
<a name="devnums"></a>

<dt><code><em>devnum(s)</em></code>
<dd><p>
    is either a single <em>devnum</em>, a range of <em>devnums</em> (separated by a '-' (dash)),
    a count of <em>devnums</em> (separated by a '.' (dot/period/stop)), or a comma separated
    list of <em>devnums</em>. Examples would be 200-210 or 0300.10 or 0400,0403 or 0100,0110-011F.
    <p>

    All devices defined when <em>devnums</em> specifies more than one device
    have identical characteristics (except for the device number itself).
    All devices defined as a group must be defined on a single channel.
    A channel is defined as a contiguous group of 256 (or hexadecimal 100) devices.
    0010 and 0020 are on the same channels. 0100 and 0210 are not.
    <p>

    See <em>devnum</em> immediately below for an explanation of how each device number is specified.

    <p />
    The 4 special subtitution symbols CUU, CCUU, cuu and ccuu are also defined for each
    device in a device group. See <a href="#subs">substitutions</a> for details.
    <p>

<dt><code><em>devnum</em></code>
<dd><p>
    is either a 1 to 4 digit hexadecimal number in the range 0000 to FFFF
    for ESA/390, or 0000 to 0FFF for S/370.  The device number uniquely
    identifies each device to the operating system.
    <p>
<dt><code><em>Channel Set / Logical Channel Subsystem</em></code>
<dd><p>
    An optional Channel Set or Logical Channel Subsystem Identification can be
    specified for a device number or group of devices. The Identification
    number is specified at the beginning of the definition, followed by a ':'
    character. For example :<p>
    1:0400-040F 3270<p>
    defines 3270 devices 400 to 40F to be on S/370 Channel Set 1 or on S/390
    or z/Architecture Logical Channel Subsystem # 1.<p>
    Since each Logical Channel Subsystem defines its own device numbering space,
    care should be taken in S/370 mode as to define a coherent set of device
    numbers.<p>
    Not all S/390 or z/Architecture operating systems support Multiple Logical
    Channel Subsystems (this feature was introduced with the z9-109).<p>
    If no Channel Set or Logical Channel Subsystem Identification is specified,
    then it is assumed to be 0.
    <p>

<dt><code><em>devtype</em></code>
<dd><p>
    is the device type.  Valid device types are shown in the
    <a href="#device_types_table">table</a> just below.
    <p>

<dt><code><em>arguments</em></code>
<dd><p>
    is a list of parameters whose meaning depends on the device type.
    The arguments required for each class of device are shown further
    below.
    <p>

<dt><code><em># comments...</em></code>
<dd><p>
    A comment preceded by a &#035; sign may be appended to any device
    definition statement.

<h4>Arguments required for each device type</h4>

<dl> <!-- begin Arguments for each device type -->

<p>
<a name="3270"></a>
<a name="loc3270"></a>
<dt><em>Local non-SNA 3270 devices</em>
<dd><p>
    There are no required arguments for this particular device type, but
    there are however several optional arguments which are discussed below.
    <p>

    To use this device, a tn3270 client must connect to the host machine
    via the port number specified on the <a href="#CNSLPORT">CNSLPORT</a>
    statement. A valid tn3270 device type, such as IBM-3278, must be used.
    <p>

    If your tn3270 client software allows you to specify a device type suffix
    (e.g. <code>IBM-3278@001F</code> ), then you can use the suffix to connect
    to that specific device number, if eligible. If no suffix is specified,
    then your client will be connected to the first available 3270 device for
    which it is eligible, if any.
    <p>

    If you specify a specific terminal device address (via the device type
    suffix of your tn3270 client software), then you must be eligible to connect
    at that device address or your connection is immediately rejected; an
    alternative terminal device for which you <i>might</i> be eligible is
    <i>not</i> automatically selected instead.
    <p>

    Optional arguments:
    <p>

    <dl>
    <a name="loc3270group"></a>
    <dt><code><em>groupname</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        If a terminal group name is given on the device statement, a device type
        suffix with this group name can be used to indicate that a device in this
        group is to be used. If a group name is specified as a terminal type suffix
        (e.g. <code>IBM-3278@GROUPNAME</code> ) and there are no devices defined
        for that group (or there are no more available devices remaining in that
        group), then the connection is rejected. If no group name is specified
        as a terminal type suffix, then the connection will only be eligible for
        any terminal devices which do <i>not</i> have a group name specified on
        their device statements. The terminal group name, if specified, should
        be 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters, the first character being alphabetic,
        and it should <i>not</i> be a hexadecimal number. Upper and lower case
        letters in the group name are considered to be equivalent.
        <p>

    <a name="loc3270ipaddr"></a>
    <dt><code><em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>mask</em> ]</code>
    <dd><p>
        The optional IP address and optional subnet mask specify the ip address(es)
        of which client(s) are allowed to connect at the device address identified
        by the device statement on which they appear. This provides an alternative
        and/or additional means of specifying to which device(s) a client tn3270
        session may, or should, connect.
        <p>

        If the IP address of the tn3270 client trying to connect, when 'and'ed with
        the optional subnet mask (which defaults to 255.255.255.255 if not specified),
        matches the IP address entered on the device statement, then the client
        is eligible to connect at that device address. Otherwise the client is
        ineligible to connect at that address and then next available device, if
        any, for which the client is eligible to connect (if any) is selected instead.
        <p>

        If no permissible terminal devices remain (i.e. terminal devices for which
        the client is eligible to connect), or there are no more available terminal
        devices remaining, then the client connection is rejected.
        <p>

        The optional IP address and subnet mask may also be specified in conjunction
        with the previously mentioned terminal group argument, but the terminal group
        argument, if specified, must be specified <i>ahead of</i> (i.e. before) the
        optional ip address and subnet mask arguments. To specify an IP address and
        subnet mask without also specifying a terminal group, simply use '*' as the
        group name instead.
        <p>

        If an IP address / subnet mask are <i>not</i> specified, then <i>any</i>
        client tn3270 session is allowed to connect to the device (provided they are also
        a member of the specified terminal group, if any).
        <p>

        The terminal group name argument, if specified, always takes precedence over
        any optional ip address and subnet mask which may also be specified.

    To summarize, the device number suffix always takes precedence over any group name
    which may also be specified, and any group name, if specified, always takes precedence
    over any ip address / subnet mask value which may also be specified.

<dd><p>

    The integrated 3270 (SYSG) console is similar to a <a href="#loc3270">local non-SNA
    3270</a> device, except that it is not addressed by subchannel number and it is
    supported only by certain system control programs. The SYSG console is defined
    like a 3270 device except that the device type is SYSG and the device number is
    ignored. Only one SYSG console can be defined in a configuration.
    <p>

    Use tn3270 client software to connect to the SYSG console device via the port number
    specified on the <a href="#CNSLPORT">CNSLPORT</a> statement, just as you would connect
    to a regular local non-SNA 3270 device.
    <p>

    The SYSG console configuration statement recognizes optional arguments which specify
    <a href="#loc3270group">group name</a> and <a href="#loc3270ipaddr">IP address</a>
    in the same way as previously described for a <a href="#loc3270">local non-SNA
    3270</a> device. These optional arguments provide a means to ensure that a given
    tn3270 client can connect directly to the SYSG console. If the group name and IP
    address arguments are not specified, then the SYSG console is considered to be a
    member of the general pool of devices eligible for connection to any incoming
    tn3270 client.

    To use this device, a telnet client must connect to the host machine
    via the port number specified on the <a href="#CNSLPORT">CNSLPORT</a> statement.
    <p>

    If your telnet client software allows you to specify a device type suffix
    (for example: <code>ansi@0009</code> ), then you can use that suffix to specify
    the specific 1052 or 3215 device to which you wish to connect. If you do not
    specify a suffix in your telnet client software (or your software does not
    allow it), then your client will be connected to the first available 1052 or
    3215 device for which it is eligible.
    <p>

    An optional <code>noprompt</code> argument may be specified on the device
    statement to cause suppression of the "Enter input for console device nnnn"
    prompt message which is otherwise normally issued to the device whenever
    the system is awaiting input on that device.
    <p>

    Additionally, a terminal group name, ip address and subnet mask may all also
    be optionally specified in the exact same manner as discussed in the previous

    The argument specifies a list of file names containing card images.
    Additional arguments may be specified after the file names:

    <dl>
    <dt><code>sockdev</code>
    <dd><p>
        indicates the card reader is a socket device wherein the
        filename is actually a socket specification instead of a
        device filename.  When used, there must only be one filename
        specified in the form: <code>port</code> or <code>host:port</code>
        or <code>sockpath/sockname</code>.  The device then accepts
        remote connections on the given TCP/IP port or Unix Domain
        Socket, and reads data from the socket instead of from a device
        file. This allows automatic remote submission of card reader
        data. See the <a href="hercrdr.html">Hercules Socket Reader</a>
        page for more details.
        <p>

    <dt><code>eof</code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies that unit exception status is presented after
        reading the last card in the file. This option is persistent, and
        will remain in effect until the reader is reinitialized with the
        <code>intrq</code> option.

    <dt><code>intrq</code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies that unit check status with intervention required

        in the file. This option is persistent, and will remain in
        effect until the reader is reinitialized with the <code>eof</code>
        option.
        <p>

    <dt><code>multifile</code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies, when multiple input files are entered, to
        automatically open the next input file and continue reading
        whenever EOF is encountered on a given file. If not specified,
        then reading stops once EOF is reached on a given file and
        an attention interrupt is then required to open and begin
        reading the next file.
        <p>

        (carraige return line feed) sequences at the end of each line.
        <p>

        If neither EBCDIC nor ASCII is specified, then the device handler
        attempts to detect the format of the card image file when the device
        is first accessed.
        Auto-detection is not supported for socket devices, and the default
        is ASCII if sockdev is specified.

        The device then accepts
        remote connections on the given TCP/IP port,
        and writes data to the socket instead of to a device
        file. This allows automatic remote spooling of line printer
        data. The sockdev option is mutually exclusive with all other

        with a unit check. This is the default.
        <p>

    <dt><code>nofcbcheck</code>

        specifies that an attempt to skip to a FCB channel for which no
        line number has been set will cause the next line of output to be
        printed on the next line on the printer output. The opposite,
        <code>fcbcheck</code>, is the default.
        <p>

    <dt><code>rawcc</code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies that printer output CCWs are not to be interpreted, but
        simply dumped in hex to the printer output file. This is useful for
        debugging. Default is to interpret printer CCWs normally.
        <p>

    <dt><code>fcb=<em>argument</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies an initial FCB image to use for this printer. The argument
        may either consist of 12 numbers separated by commas (these are the
        line numbers for channels 1 to 12), or of pairs of numbers in the
        format <em>nn</em><b>:</b><em>chan</em> where <em>chan</em> is the
        channel number and <em>nn</em> is the line number that the channel
        corresponds to. Use <code>00</code> to leave the line number unset
        for a channel (see <code>fcbcheck</code> above). The default is
        <code>fcb=1,7,13,19,25,31,37,43,63,49,55,61</code>
        which is equivalent to
        <code>fcb=1:1,7:2,13:3,19:4,25:5,31:6,37:7,43:8,63:9,49:10,55:11,61:12</code>

    <dt><code>browse &#124; print</code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies whether the output should be optimized and cleaned up for
        browsing, or optimized for printing. The default is <code>browse</code>.
        <p>

    <dt><code>index=<em>nn</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies 3211 indexing. Valid values are 0 to 31. The default is 0.
        <p>

    <dt><code>lpi=6&#124;8</code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies vertical spacing of 6 or 8 lines per inch.
        <p>

    <dt><code>lpp=<em>nn</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        specifies the number of lines per page. The default is 66.
        <p>

    </dl>

    <p>

    If the filename begins with the vertical bar '&#124;' pipe character,
    then it is removed and the remainder of the filename is interpreted as
    a command line (the name of a program or batch file followed by any
    necessary arguments) to which to "pipe" the printer output to.
    This is known as the "print-to-pipe" feature. All printer output
    is then sent to the piped program's stdin input, and all of the
    piped program's stdout and stderr output is piped back to Hercules
    for displaying on the hardware console.

    <p>
    If the "print-to-pipe" command line contains arguments, then quotes
    must be placed around the entire filename string including the
    vertical bar, for example:
    <pre>
    000E 1403 "|/usr/bin/lpr -Phplj" crlf          <em>(for Unix)</em>
    000E 1403 "|c:\utils\pr -s -PLPT1:" crlf       <em>(for Windows)</em>
    </pre>
    The above example uses the pr program downloaded
    from <a href="http://www.atnetsend.net/computing/">
    http://www.atnetsend.net/computing/</a>
    <p>
    If the "print-to-pipe" command line itself contains quotes, then
    the command line must be enclosed in apostrophes instead of quotes,
    for example:
    <pre>
    000E 1403 '|"c:\Program Files\My Utils\pr" -s -PLPT1:' crlf
    </pre>
    <p>
    Tim Pinkawa has an example which shows how the print-to-pipe feature
    can be used to create output in PDF format:

<dt><em>Emulated tape devices</em>
<dd><p>
    Five types of tape emulation are supported (see further below).
    <p>

    The only required parameter is the device filename. All other parameters
    are optional and must follow the filename. Use '<b>*</b>' (asterisk) for
    the filename to specify an empty (unmounted) tape drive. The specified file,
    if other than '<b>*</b>', <i>must</i> exist.
    <p>
    Additionally, if the file name starts with the '@' character (at sign), the file
    really describes a list of tape emulation files to be loaded in succession.
    <p>

    The syntax of each line is identical to the information that can be
    specified after the device type when the options are specified directly
    after the device type in the configuration file.
    <p>

    If the emulation file filename in the file list is the '<b>*</b>' (asterisk)
    character, then this specifies a set of options to be applied to <i>all</i>
    additional emulation files specified in the file list.
    <p>

    Parameters are appended in succession. In all cases, if the same parameter is
    specified more than once, the last instance takes precedence.
    <p>

    Therefore, it is possible to specify a set of parameters in the base configuration
    file, another set on a '*' line, and another set for each individual line.
    Parameters are then appended in that order: options specified on the base device
    statement itself first, followed by those options specified on the '*' statement,
    and finally those specified on each individual file list statement last. <i>A
    <b>SCSI tape</b> device should <b>not</b> be given in a file list.</i>
    <p>

    Refer to the distributed source-code's "<b>README.TAPE</b>" document for
    additional information regarding system and application programming for tape
    devices and instructions regarding use of the emulated <b>ACF</b> (Automatic
    Cartridge Feeder) and <b><a href="#AUTOMOUNT">AUTOMOUNT</a></b> features
    for virtual (non-SCSI) tape devices.
    <p>

    <dl> <!-- begin Emulated tape types of emulation -->

    <dt><b>SCSI tape drives</b>
    <dd><p>
        These are real tape drives attached to the host machine via a SCSI
        interface. Hercules emulation always makes the drive appear as a
        channel attached device such as 3420 or 3480, although the underlying
        physical drive may be any type of SCSI attached tape drive, including
        4mm or 8mm DAT, DLT, SCSI attached 3480/3490 cartridge drives, and
        SCSI attached 3420 open reel tape drives.
        <p>
        Host-attached SCSI tapes are read and written using variable length
        EBCDIC blocks and filemarks exactly like a mainframe tape volume, and
        as a result can be freely used/exchanged on either (i.e. SCSI tapes
        created on a real mainframe can subsequently be read by Hercules just
        fine, and a SCSI tape created by Hercules can be subsequently read on
        a mainframe just fine, thus providing a convenient means of exchanging
        data between the two).
        <p>
        If you plan on using SCSI tapes with Hercules you might also be interested
        in the <a href="#AUTO_SCSI_MOUNT">AUTO_SCSI_MOUNT</a> configuration option.
        <p>
        The only <i>required</i> device statement parameter for SCSI attached tape
        drives is the name of the device as it is known
        by the host operating system,
        usually &nbsp;"<code><b>/dev/nst0</b></code>"&nbsp; <i>(for Linux or
        Windows)</i> or &nbsp;"<code><b>\\.\Tape0</b></code>" &nbsp; <i>(for
        Windows only)</i>, where '0' means tape drive number
        0 (your first or only host-attached SCSI tape drive), '1' means your
        second host-attached SCSI tape drive, etc.
        <p>
        Depending on what actual model of SCSI tape drive you
        actually have and how it behaves, you may need to specify one or more
        additional optional parameters for Hercules to provide proper emulation
        of the desired device type.
        For example: a <b>Quantum 'DLT' (Digital Linear Tape) SCSI</b> tape drive does
        not return nor use a block-id format compatible with 3480/3490 drives
        (it instead uses a full 32-bit block-id just like the model 3590 does).
        It also does not support the Erase Gap CCW at all.
        <p>
        Thus, in order to use, for example, a Quantum DLT drive with Hercules,
        you <i>MUST</i> specify some special additional options to prevent the
        Erase Gap command from being issued to the drive as well as to inform
        Hercules that the drive uses 32-bit block-ids.
        <p>
        <b>Please note</b> that the below options define how the actual SCSI hardware
        device behaves, which is completely different from the way the <i>emulated</i>
        device will appear to behave to your guest. That is to say, if you define
        your tape drive to Hercules as a 3480 device, then Hercules will perform
        3480 device type emulation such that the device appears to your guest o/s
        as if it were a 3480 device. If the <i>actual</i> SCSI device behaves as
        a 3590 device however (perhaps using/returning 32-bit block-ids instead
        of the expected 22-bit format block-ids that 3480's use), then you <i>MUST</i>
        specify the <code>--blkid-32</code> special option on your Hercules device
        statement so that Hercules's emulation logic can know that it needs to
        translate 22-bit block-ids to 32-bit ones before sending them to the
        actual SCSI hardware (and vice versa: to translate 32-bit block-ids from
        the actual SCSI drive into 22-bit format block-ids that your guest expects
        from a 3480 device).

                <center><h4>Special options for SCSI tapes</h4></center>
        <p>
        As explained just above, certain model SCSI tape drives such as the Quantum
        DLT series may require special handling in order to provide the desired proper
        device type emulation. These special options are:
        <p>
        <dl>
        <dt><code>--no-erg</code>
        <dd><p>
            This option is intended to prevent issuance of the Erase Gap
            command to those SCSI tape drives which do not support it (such
            as the Quantum DLT series). It causes Hercules's device emulation
            logic to ignore any Erase Gap commands issued to the drive and
            to return immediate 'success' instead.
            <p>
            This option should
            only be used (specified) for drives such as the Quantum, which
            support switching from read mode to write mode in the middle of
            a data stream without the need of an intervening Erase Gap command.
            Specifying it for any other model SCSI drive may cause incorrect
            functioning as a result of the Erase Gap command not being issued
            to the actual SCSI hardware.
            <p>
            Check the manufacturer information for your particular model of
            SCSI-attached tape drive (and/or use Fish's
            "<a href="http://www.softdevlabs.com/Hercules">ftape</a>"
            Windows utility)
            to determine whether or not this option is needed for your
            particular drive.
            <p>
        <dt><code>--blkid-32</code>
        <dd><p>
            This option indicates that your SCSI-attached tape drive only
            supports 32-bit block-ids (as used by 3590 drives) and not the 22-bit
            format used by 3480/3490 drives. You should only specify this option
            if you intend to define the drive as a model 3480 or 3490 device, and
            then only if your actual SCSI drive uses 32-bit block-ids of course.
            If you define your Hercules tape drive as a model 3590 device however,
            then this option is of course not needed since model 3590 drives
            are already presumed to use 32-bit block-ids.
            <p>
            Specifying this option on a 3480/3490 device statement will cause
            Hercules device emulation logic to automatically translate the actual
            SCSI tape drive's 32-bit block-id into 22-bit format before returning
            it back to the guest operating system (since that is the format it
            expects it to be in for a model 3480/3490 drive), and to translate the
            guest's 22-bit format block-id into 32-bit format before sending it
            to the actual SCSI hardware (since that is the format that the actual
            hardware requires it to be in).

    <dt><b>Optical Media Attach (OMA) virtual files</b>
    <dd><p>
        These are read-only files which usually reside on CDROM.
        OMA virtual tapes consist of one CDROM file corresponding
        to each physical file of the emulated tape.  An ASCII text
        file called the tape descriptor file (TDF) specifies the
        names of the files which make up the virtual tape.
        The argument specifies the name of the tape descriptor
        file (for example <code>/cdrom/tapes/uaa196.tdf</code>)
        <p>

        Each file on the virtual tape can be in one of three formats:
        <p>

        <dl>
        <dt><code>TEXT</code>
        <dd><p>
            <b><i>TEXT</i></b> files consist of variable length
            ASCII records delimited by carriage return line feed
            sequences at the end of each record.  Each record is
            translated to EBCDIC and presented to the program as
            one physical tape block.
            <p>

        <dt><code>FIXED <em>nnnnn</em></code>
        <dd><p>
            <b><i>FIXED</i></b> files consist of fixed length
            EBCDIC blocks of the specified length
            (<code><em>nnnnn</em></code>)
            <p>

        <dt><code>HEADERS</code>
        <dd><p>
            <b><i>HEADERS</i></b> files consist of variable
            length EBCDIC blocks.  Each block is preceded by a
            12-byte header.
            <p>

        </dl>
        <p>

        If you have any IBM manuals in Bookmanager format on CDROM,

    <dt><b>AWSTAPE virtual files</b>

        These contain a complete tape in one file.  AWSTAPE files
        consist of variable length EBCDIC blocks.  Each block is

        a 6-byte header with no data.  This is the same format as is
        used by the P/390.
        The argument specifies the location of the AWSTAPE file
        (for example <code>ickdsf.aws</code>)
        <p><br>

    <dt><b>FakeTape virtual files</b>
    <dd><p>
        These contain a complete tape in one file.  FakeTape files

        a 12-character header with no data.  The FakeTape format is
        used by the Flex-ES system from Fundamental Software Inc (FSI).
        The argument specifies the location of the FakeTape file
        (for example <code>ickdsf.fkt</code>). Note: "FLEX-ES" and
        "FakeTape" are trademarks of Fundamental Software, Inc.
        <p><br>

    <dt><b>HET virtual files</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; (<b>H</b>ercules <b>E</b>mulated <b>T</b>ape)
    <dd><p>
        These contain a complete tape in one file and have the same
        structure as the AWSTAPE format with the added ability to have
        compressed data.
        The first argument specifies the location of the HET file.  The
        filename must end with ".het" to be recognized by Hercules as an
        HET file.
        (for example <code>023178.het</code>)
        <p>

        Additional arguments that allow you to control various HET settings
        are:
        <p>

        <dl> <!-- begin Additional HET arguments -->
        <dt><code>AWSTAPE</code>
        <dd><p>
            The <code>AWSTAPE</code> argument causes HET files to
            be written in AWSTAPE format.  This basically, disables
            the additional features provided by the HET format.
            <p>

        <dt><code>COMPRESS=<em>n</em></code>
        <dt><code>IDRC=<em>n</em></code>
        <dd><p>
            <code>COMPRESS</code> and <code>IDRC</code> control
            whether compression should be used when writing to HET
            files.  The value <code><em>n</em></code> &nbsp;can be <code>1</code>
            to turn on compression (the default) or <code>0</code> to turn
            it off.  <code>IDRC</code> is currently a synonym for
            <code>COMPRESS</code>, but may be used in the future to
            control other emulated tape drive features.
            <p>

        <dt><code>METHOD=<em>n</em></code>
        <dd><p>
            The <code>METHOD</code> option allows you to specify
            which compression method to use.  You may specify
            <code>1</code> for ZLIB compression or <code>2</code>
            for BZIP2 compression.  The default is <code>1</code>.
            <p>

        <dt><code>LEVEL=<em>n</em></code>
        <dd><p>
            The <code>LEVEL</code> option controls the level of
            compression.  It ranges from <code>1</code> for fastest
            compression to <code>9</code> &nbsp;for best compression.
            The default is <code>4</code>.
            <p>

        <dt><code>CHUNKSIZE=<em>nnnnn</em></code>
        <dd><p>
            The <code>CHUNKSIZE</code> option allows you to create
            HET files that contain different chunk sizes.  The AWSTAPE
            (and therefore the HET) format allows each tape block to be
            logically broken up into smaller chunks.  For instance, if
            your S/3x0 application creates tapes with a block size of
            27998, those blocks would be broken down into
            <code><em>nnnnn</em></code> &nbsp;sized chunks.
            The range is from <code>4096</code>
            to <code>65535</code>, the latter being the default.
            Decreasing the value from its default may reduce compression
            performance.
            For compatability with AWSTAPE files created by the P/390,
            specify <code>AWSTAPE</code> with <code>CHUNKSIZE=4096</code>.

        <dd><p>
            Specifies the maximum size (in bytes, Kilobytes or Megabytes)
            that the emulated file is allowed to grow to. Specifying zero
            for this parameter means "unlimited" (i.e. there is no limit).
            <p>

        <dt><code>EOTMARGIN</code>=<em>n</em>
        <dd><p>
            Specifies the number of bytes remaining before reaching <em>maxsize</em>
            at which point the tape device will signal the presence of the "End of Tape"
            marker (reflector), thus allowing the program to switch to the next tape.
            <p>

        <dt><code>READONLY</code>=<em>n</em>
        <dd><p>
            Specifies whether the tape is mounted read-only (without a write
            ring or with the cartridge protect switch set to "write
            protect").  A parameter of 1 means read-only; a parameter of 0
            means read-write.  If READONLY=1, RO or NORING is not specified,
            the default is READONLY=0.  Note that READONLY=0 does not override
            the host system file permission settings for the underlying AWS or
            HET file.  If the AWS or HET file is marked read-only, the tape
            will be mounted read-only despite specification of READONLY=0.
            <p>

        <dt><code>RO</code>

        <dt><code>RW</code>
        <dt><code>RING</code>
        <dd><p>
            Specifies that the tape should be mounted read-write, if possible.
            RW and RING are equivalent to READONLY=0.  This is the default if

        <dd><p>
            Specifies whether a device end is presented if intervention is

<a name="noautomount"></a>

        <dd><p>
            Indicates support for guest-initiated automatic tape volume
            mounting is to always be disabled for this tape device.
            <p>
            Automatic guest tape-mount support is automatically globally
            enabled for all virtual (non-SCSI) tape devices by default
            whenever an allowable automount directory is defined via the
            <a href="#AUTOMOUNT">AUTOMOUNT</a> configuration file statement
            or the <code>automount</code> panel command.
            The <code>NOAUTOMOUNT</code> option allows you to specifically
            disable such support for a given device.
            <p>
            The automount feature enables software running in guest operating
            systems to automatically mount, unmount and/or query for themselves
            the host "virtual tape volume" filename mounted on a tape drive,
            via the use of special CCW opcodes (0x4B Set Diagnose and 0xE4
            Sense Id) without any intervention on the part of the Hercules
            operator. An example of such a program for DOS/VSE called
            <code>TMOUNT</code> is provided in the <code>util</code>
            subdirectory of the distributed source code.
            <p>
            This is a sticky option. When specified, automount support for
            the device remains disabled until the option is specifically
            removed via a <code>devinit</code> command <em>without</em> the option
            specified. This means if <code>NOAUTOMOUNT</code> is enabled
            for a device while global automount functionality is currently
            disabled (because no <a href="#AUTOMOUNT">AUTOMOUNT</a> statement
            was specified at Hercules startup), then automount functionality
            remains disabled for the device even should global automount
            functionality be later manually enabled via an
            <code>automount</code> panel command.
            <p>
            When the 0x4B Set Diagnose CCW is used to auto-mount a virtual
            tape volume onto a given tape drive, an absolute (fully-qualified)
            pathname should normally always be specified, but need not be
            if a path relative to the currently defined "default allowable"
            automount directory is used instead.
            <p>
            The default allowable
            automount directory is always the first "allowable" directory
            that was defined, or else the current directory if no allowable
            directories were specifically defined. (There is always a default
            allowable directory whenever any allowable or unallowable automount
            directories are defined.)
            <p>
            Fully-resolved, absolute-full-path filenames are defined as being
            those which, for Windows, have a ':' (colon) in the second
            position or, for other host operating systems (e.g. Linux), have
            a '/' (slash) in the first position. Paths which start with a '.'
            (period) are considered relative paths and will always be appended
            to the currently defined default allowable automount directory,
            before being resolved into fully-qualified paths by the host system.
            (I.e. only fully-resolved absolute pathnames are used in the
            performance of the actual automatic tape volume mount.)
            <p>
            For example, if more than one allowable automount directory is
            defined and the volume wishing to be mounted happens to reside in
            the second one, then a fully-qualified absolute pathname should
            of course be specified (or else one that is relative to the
            default directory which happens to resolve to the desired file).
            <p>
            All attempts to automount host files in a "disallowed"
            directory or any of its subdirectories will be rejected.
            Similarly any attempt to automount a file which is not
            within any "allowable" directory or subdirectory will
            be rejected. An error message is always issued in such cases.
            A message is also issued whenever a successful mount or unmount
            is performed.
            <p>
            A sample guest automount program called <code>TMOUNT</code> for
            the DOS/VSE operating system is provided in the
            <code>util</code> subdirectory of the distributed source code.

        This emulation mode appears to the operating system running in
        the Hercules machine as an IBM 3088 Channel to Channel Adapter.
        It provides communication via a TCP connection with another
        instance of the CTCT driver, and is designed to carry TCP/IP
        communications between two guest TCP/IP stacks.
        CTCT may also be used for communication between the client and

        <dt><code><em>lport</em></code>
        <dd><p>

        of port numbers per device side. Only the even port numbers are
        to be configured; the odd numbers are just derived by adding 1
        to the (configured) even port numbers. The socket connection
        pairs cross-connect, the arrows showing the send->receive

        router, a 3172 running ICP (Interconnect Communications Program),
        the LCS3172 driver of a P/390, or an IBM Open Systems Adapter.
        <p>

        Rather than a point-to-point link, this emulation creates a

        running in the Hercules machine can communicate. As such, this
        mode is not limited to TCP/IP traffic, but in fact will handle

    The argument specifies the name of a file containing the disk CKD
    DASD image or the INET address of a <a href="shared.html">Hercules shared device server</a>.
    <p>

    The file consists of a 512-byte device header record
    followed by fixed length track images.  The length of each track
    image depends on the emulated device type, and is always rounded
    up to the next multiple of 512 bytes.
    <p>

    Volumes larger than 2GB (for example, the 3390 model 3)
    can be supported by spreading the data across more than one file.
    Each file contains a whole number of cylinders.  The first file
    (which contains cylinders 0-2518 in the case of a 3390) usually
    has _1 as the last two characters of its name.  The ckddasd driver
    allocates the remaining files by replacing the last character of
    the file name by the characters 2, 3, etc.
    <p>

    <em><b>Note:</b> &nbsp;When CKD DASD images are spread across multiple files, you must
    specify only the first file name (the file with suffix _1) in the

    a compressed CKD DASD image.  The CKD driver will automatically detect
    whether the file contains a regular CKD image or a compressed CKD
    image.
    <p>

    Refer to "Creating an empty DASD volume" in the "Creating, formatting,
    and loading DASD volumes" section of the
    <a href="hercload.html">Creating DASD</a>
    web page for information on using the 'dasdinit' command/utility to
    create compressed dasd files. Refer to the
    <a href="cckddasd.html">Compressed Dasd Emulation</a>
    page for details on the actual CCKD emulation itself and additional
    information on the <a href="cckddasd.html#cckdcommand">CCKD</a>

    <p>

    If you specify an INET address, the format is:
    <p>

    <dl> <!-- begin INET parms -->
    <dt><code><em>ip-name-or-addr</em>:<em>port</em>:<em>devnum</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        <em>ip-name-or-addr</em> specifies the internet name or address
        where the <a href="shared.html">Hercules shared device server</a> is running.
        <p>

        <em>port</em> specifies the port number the shared device server
        is listening on.  If omitted, the default is 3990.
        <p>

        <em>devnum</em> specifies the device number on the shared
        device server.  If omitted, the default is the current device number.
        <p>

    <dt><code>sf=<em>shadow-file-name</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        A shadow file contains all the changes made to the emulated dasd since
        it was created, until the next shadow file is created. The moment of the
        shadow file's creation can be thought of as a snapshot of the current
        emulated dasd at that time, because if the shadow file is later removed,
        then the emulated dasd reverts back to the state it was at when the snapshot
        was taken.
        <p>

        Using shadow files, you can keep the base file on a read-only device such
        as cdrom, or change the base file attributes to read-only, ensuring that
        this file can never be corrupted.
        <p>

        Hercules console commands are provided to add a new shadow file, remove
        the current shadow file (with or without backward merge), compress the
        current shadow file, and display the shadow file status and statistics
        <p>

        For detailed information regarding shadow files and their use, please
        see the "<a href="cckddasd.html#shadowfiles">Shadow Files</a>" section
        of the <a href="cckddasd.html">Compressed Dasd Emulation</a> web page.

    <dt><code>[no]syncio</code>
    <dd><p>
        syncio enables possible 'synchronous' i/o. This is a dasd i/o feature
        wherein guest i/o requests are completed "synchronously" during the
        actual emulated execution of the SIO/SSCH (start-i/o / start subchannel)
        instruction rather than being deferred and executed asynchronously in
        a separate device i/o thread.
        <p>

        Only i/o which are known to be able to be completed without actually
        needing to perform any actual host i/o are completed synchronously (e.g.
        whenever the data being requested is found to already be in cache). If
        the requested data is not found in the cache, then an actual host i/o
        will need to be done and the request is passed to a device i/o thread
        to be completed asyncronously instead.
        <p>

        syncio is the default for ckd. syncio statistics may be displayed via
        the Hercules <code>syncio</code> panel command.
        <p>

        <!-- No longer applicable with current versions of Linux
        <b>Note:</b> If you plan on using syncio with <b>Linux/390</b> and/or <b>zLinux</b>

        Specifies the type of control unit to which this device is attached.
        The use of this parameter does not necessarily imply that
        all functions of the specified control unit are emulated,
        its only purpose is to force a particular control unit type
        to be indicated in the data returned by SENSE ID and similar CCW's.

<dt><em>Communication Line - BSC</em>
<dd><p>
    ( Preliminary 2703 BSC Support )
    <p>

    Describes a BSC emulation line entry to either link 2 Hercules engines
    or a custom made program emulating a 2780, 3780 or 3x74, or a custom made
    program interfacing to a real BSC line.
    <p>

    The communication is emulated over a TCP connection. All bytes are
    transfered as-is (except for doubling DLE in transparent mode) just
    like it would over a real BSC link. Emulated EIA (DCD, DTR, CTS,
    etc..) or X.21/V.11 leads (C, T, etc..) are treated differently depending
    on the DIAL option selected.
    <p>

    The line emulates a point-to-point BSC link. There is no point-to-multipoint handling.
    <p>

    The following options define the line emulation behaviour:
    <p>

    <dl> <!-- begin Communication Adapter parms -->

    <dt><code>DIAL=IN &#124; OUT &#124; INOUT &#124; NO</code>
    <dd><p>
        Specifies call direction (if any). If <code>DIAL=NO</code> is specified, the
        TCP outgoing connection is attempted as soon as an 'ENABLE' CCW is executed.
        Also, in this mode, an incoming connection will always be accepted. If <code>DIAL=IN&#124;INOUT</code>
        is specified, a TCP incoming call is accepted ONLY if an 'ENABLE' CCW is currently
        executing on the device. If <code>DIAL=OUT</code>, the 'ENABLE' CCW is rejected.
        When <code>DIAL=IN&#124;INOUT</code> is specified, a DIAL CCW allows the application
        to establish a TCP connection to a specific host. For other DIAL values,
        the DIAL CCW is rejected.
        <p>

    <dt><code>lhost=<em>hostname</em> &#124; <em>ip address</em> &#124; *</code>
    <dd><p>
        Specifies which IP address to listen on. This also conditions the network
        interface from which incoming calls will be accepted. Specifying '*' means
        all incoming TCP calls are accepted, regardless of the destination IP
        address or call origin. This is the default value. Specifying a specific
        IP address when <code>DIAL=OUT</code> is specified has no effect.
        <p>

    <dt><code>lport=<em>service name</em> &#124; <em>port number</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        Specifies the TCP port for which to listen to incoming TCP calls. This
        value is mandatory for <code>DIAL=IN&#124;INOUT&#124;NO</code>. It is ignored for <code>DIAL=OUT</code>.
        <p>

    <dt><code>rhost=<em>hostname</em> &#124; <em>ip address</em></code>
    <dt><code>rport=<em>service name</em> &#124; <em>port number</em></code>
    <dd><p>
        Specifies the remote host and port to which to direct a TCP connection on a
        DIAL=NO line when an 'ENABLE' CCW is executed. This option is mandatory when <code>DIAL=NO</code>
        is specified. It is ignored for other <code>DIAL</code> values.
        <p>

    The following options are tuning options. In most cases, using the default values

    <dt><code>rto=0 &#124; -1 &#124; <em>nnn</em> &#124; 3000</code>
    <dd><p>
        Specifies the number of milliseconds before terminating a read on a timeout, when
        no read termination control character is received. Specifying 0 means the READ ends
        immediately. -1 specifies there is no timeout.
        <p>

    <dt><code>pto=0 &#124; -1 &#124; <em>nnn</em> &#124; 3000</code>
    <dd><p>
        Specifies the number of milliseconds before terminating a POLL on a timeout, when
        no ACK or NACK sequence is received. Specifying 0 means the POLL ends
        immediately. -1 specifies there is no timeout.
        <p>

    <dt><code>eto=0 &#124; -1 &#124; <em>nnn</em> &#124; 10000</code>
    <dd><p>
        Specifies the number of milliseconds before terminating an ENABLE operation on a timeout.
        the timeout applies when <code>DIAL=NO&#124;IN&#124;INOUT</code> is specified, the outgoing TCP call
        fails (<code>DIAL=NO</code>) and there is no previously or currently established TCP connection
        for this line. When <code>DIAL=NO</code> is specified, the timeout defaults to 10 seconds.
        For <code>DIAL=IN&#124;INOUT</code>, the timeout defaults to -1.
